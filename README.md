# Few words about me 

Hello,

I'm Pietro Prebianca, a software developer ðŸ’» from Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹.

Since 2016, I have been studying videogames ðŸŽ® from both a technical and design point of view.

I'm all about videogames.

# Work and other activities

I work from May 2022, mainly, as back-end developer: technically speaking, I use Springboot.
Dealing with webservice, inevitably there is the need of some sort of dbms: currently I'm working a lot
with MariaDB and MongoDb. At the moment, I'm a sort of junior developer, because my main duties are 
just developing functionalties: I do not take part (yet) to all the decision making process, in which
every project is involved.

Beside my main work, I coordinate a small game dev group called "Lazy Duck Games".
In this group, I am the head leader, which means:


Currently, We are following three projects:

- Spinning Tower (Unity3D)
- Cloudy Mess (Unity3D)
- Iron (Godot)

When I said "I'm all about videogames", I literally mean it, because I also take part to many game jams.
