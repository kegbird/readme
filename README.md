# Few words about me

Hello,

I'm Pietro Prebianca, a sowftware developer from Italy.
Since 2016, I study videogames from both a technical and design point of view.
This passion drives me into many game jams and many game dev projects as You will see in next section.
Beside game dev, I enjoy readind, cooking and playing accordeon.
Yes, I'm all about videogames.
