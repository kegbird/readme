# Few words about me 🙂
Hello,

I'm Pietro Prebianca, a software developer 💻 from Italy 🇮🇹.

Since 2016, I have been studying videogames 🎮 from both a technical and design point of view.

I'm all about videogames.

# Work and other activities 🧑‍💻

I work from May 2022, as back-end developer: technically speaking, I use Springboot and I work a lot with relational and nosql dbms.

Beside my main work, I coordinate a small game dev group called "Lazy Duck Games".
In this group, I organize our activities and manage all techincal aspects of the videogames we create.

Currently, We are following three projects:

- Sadie (Unity3D)
- Cloudy Mess (Unity3D)

And beside these projects, guess, I do game jam aswell!
