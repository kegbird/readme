# Few words about me 

Hello,

I'm Pietro Prebianca, a software developer from Italy.
Since 2016, I have been studying videogames from both a technical and design point of view.
This passion drives me into many game jams and many game dev projects as You will see in next section.
Beside game dev, I enjoy readind, cooking and playing accordeon.
But yes, I'm all about videogames.

# Work and other activities

I work from May 2022, mainly, as back-end developer: technically speaking, I use Springboot.
